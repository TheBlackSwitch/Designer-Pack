# Pack Explanation:
Have you ever wanted to design something in your survival world but are you to lazy to save your world and switch to a creative world?
Or are you playing with friends on a server and want to design something together?
Well than I have the perfect solution for you: desginer pack!

_**Designer pack is a datapack which allows you to design a build directly in your survival playthrough!**_
This pack has 5 different types of super flat creative worlds where you can freely design your builds alone and together! Just type /trigger designer set <1-5> to go to the desired plot!

**Here is an overview:**
| Plot                | World Type            |
|---------------------|:---------------------:|
| Plot 1              | Default Super Flat    |
| Plot 2              | Quartz World          |
| Plot 3              | Redstone Ready        |
| Plot 4              | Empty Void            |
| Plot 5              | Generic Overworld     |

_**And that without interfering with your survival world!**_ When you trigger designer, your inventory will be stored aswell as your xp points! Then when you've decided to hop back into survival, your inventory and xp will be given back to you, even in the right slots! 

Designer pack also has a settings menu where you can change your gamemode on the plot and other settings! The operator can also change the default gamemode on the main world! And disable players from changing their gamemodes on plots!
